Comprehensive summary of all the deep learning models we've covered:

1. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

- Basic building block of deep learning
- Consists of input layer, hidden layers, and output layer
- Uses backpropagation for learning
- Good for structured/tabular data
- Applications: Classification, regression, pattern recognition

```python
model = Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_dim,)),
    Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    Dense(output_dim, activation='softmax')
])
```

2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

- Specialized for processing grid-like data (images)
- Key components: Convolution layers, pooling layers, fully connected layers
- Features: Local connectivity, parameter sharing
- Applications: Image classification, object detection, computer vision

```python
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(64,64,3)),
    MaxPooling2D(2,2),
    Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```

3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

- Designed for sequential data
- Maintains internal memory/state
- Variants: LSTM, GRU
- Applications: Time series, NLP, speech recognition

```python
model = Sequential([
    LSTM(50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(sequence_length, features)),
    LSTM(50),
    Dense(1)
])
```

4. Self Organizing Maps (SOM)

- Unsupervised learning algorithm
- Creates low-dimensional representation of data
- Preserves topological properties
- Applications: Dimensionality reduction, clustering, visualization

```python
from minisom import MiniSom
som = MiniSom(x=10, y=10, input_len=len(features), sigma=1.0, learning_rate=0.5)
som.train_random(data, 100)
```

5. Boltzmann Machines

- Generative stochastic neural network
- Learns probability distribution over inputs
- Variants: Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM)
- Applications: Feature learning, pattern recognition

```python
# RBM implementation example
class RBM:
    def __init__(self, num_visible, num_hidden):
        self.W = np.random.randn(num_visible, num_hidden)
        self.visible_bias = np.zeros(num_visible)
        self.hidden_bias = np.zeros(num_hidden)
```

6. AutoEncoders

- Unsupervised learning algorithm
- Learns compressed representation of data
- Architecture: Encoder-decoder structure
- Applications: Dimensionality reduction, denoising, feature learning

```python
model = Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_dim,)),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),  # Encoded representation
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(input_dim, activation='sigmoid')
])
```

7. Stacked AutoEncoders

- Multiple autoencoder layers stacked together
- Each layer trains on encoded output of previous layer
- Deeper feature learning
- Applications: Deep feature extraction, hierarchical representation

```python
model = Sequential([
    # Encoder
    Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_dim,)),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    # Decoder
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(input_dim, activation='sigmoid')
])
```

Key Considerations for Model Selection:

1. Data Type:

- Structured data → ANN
- Image data → CNN
- Sequential data → RNN
- Unlabeled data → Autoencoders/SOM

2. Problem Type:

- Supervised learning → ANN, CNN, RNN
- Unsupervised learning → Autoencoders, SOM, Boltzmann Machines
- Dimensionality reduction → Autoencoders, SOM

3. Computational Resources:

- Limited resources → Simpler architectures
- GPU availability → Deeper networks possible

4. Data Size:

- Small dataset → Simpler models, transfer learning
- Large dataset → Deeper architectures

This provides a high-level overview of the major deep learning models. Each has its strengths and ideal use cases, and understanding these helps in choosing the right model for specific problems.
