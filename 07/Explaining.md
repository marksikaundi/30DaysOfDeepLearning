Sample dataset for this exercise. Below is a small dataset containing information about individuals, including their age, salary, and city of residence. You can copy this dataset into a CSV file or directly use it in your code.

### Sample Dataset

```python
import pandas as pd

# Creating a sample dataset
data = {
    'age': [25, 45, 35, 50, 23, 40, 30, 28, 33, 38],
    'salary': [50000, 100000, 75000, 120000, 45000, 80000, 60000, 52000, 70000, 85000],
    'city': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago', 'Houston', 'Phoenix', 'Philadelphia', 'San Antonio', 'San Diego', 'Dallas', 'San Jose']
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print("Original Dataset:\n", df)
```

### Preprocessing Steps

1. **Splitting the dataset into features and target (if applicable)**:
   - For this example, we will assume that we are only preprocessing the features and not dealing with a target variable.

2. **Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets**:
   - This step ensures that we have separate data for training and testing our model.

3. **Applying scaling to numerical features**:
   - We will use StandardScaler to standardize the numerical features (`age` and `salary`).

4. **Applying one-hot encoding to categorical features**:
   - We will use OneHotEncoder to encode the categorical feature (`city`).

5. **Concatenating the preprocessed numerical and categorical features**:
   - Finally, we will combine the scaled numerical features and the encoded categorical features to form the final preprocessed dataset.

### Preprocessing Code

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder
import numpy as np

# Splitting the dataset into features (X)
X = df[['age', 'salary', 'city']]

# Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test = train_test_split(X, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Applying scaling to numerical features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train[['age', 'salary']] = scaler.fit_transform(X_train[['age', 'salary']])
X_test[['age', 'salary']] = scaler.transform(X_test[['age', 'salary']])

# Applying one-hot encoding to categorical features
one_hot_encoder = OneHotEncoder(sparse=False)
X_train_city_encoded = one_hot_encoder.fit_transform(X_train[['city']])
X_test_city_encoded = one_hot_encoder.transform(X_test[['city']])

# Concatenating the encoded categorical features with the scaled numerical features
X_train_preprocessed = np.hstack((X_train[['age', 'salary']], X_train_city_encoded))
X_test_preprocessed = np.hstack((X_test[['age', 'salary']], X_test_city_encoded))

print("Preprocessed Training Data:\n", X_train_preprocessed)
print("Preprocessed Testing Data:\n", X_test_preprocessed)
```

### Explanation of Steps

1. **Splitting the dataset into features**:
   - We selected the columns `age`, `salary`, and `city` as our features.

2. **Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets**:
   - We used `train_test_split` to split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

3. **Applying scaling to numerical features**:
   - We initialized a `StandardScaler` and used it to fit and transform the `age` and `salary` columns in the training set. We then transformed the `age` and `salary` columns in the testing set using the same scaler.

4. **Applying one-hot encoding to categorical features**:
   - We initialized a `OneHotEncoder` and used it to fit and transform the `city` column in the training set. We then transformed the `city` column in the testing set using the same encoder.

5. **Concatenating the preprocessed numerical and categorical features**:
   - We used `np.hstack` to horizontally stack the scaled numerical features and the encoded categorical features, resulting in the final preprocessed training and testing datasets.

By following these steps, we have successfully preprocessed the dataset, making it ready for further analysis or modeling.
