Present a few hands-on challenges to help reinforce your understanding of Deep Reinforcement Learning and DQN implementation.

**Challenge 1: LunarLander Environment**
Let's modify our DQN to solve the LunarLander-v2 environment, which is more complex than CartPole.

```python
import gym
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import numpy as np
from collections import deque
import random

# Modified DQN for LunarLander
class DQN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):
        super(DQN, self).__init__()
        self.network = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_size, 128),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(128, 64),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(64, output_size)
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.network(x)

# Challenge: Complete the training loop for LunarLander
def train_lunar_lander():
    env = gym.make('LunarLander-v2')
    state_size = env.observation_space.shape[0]  # 8 dimensions
    action_size = env.action_space.n  # 4 actions

    # Your code here
    # Implement the training loop
    # Target: Achieve average score > 200 over 100 episodes

```

**Challenge 2: Implement Prioritized Experience Replay**
Enhance the DQN with prioritized experience replay to improve learning efficiency.

```python
class PrioritizedReplayBuffer:
    def __init__(self, capacity):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.buffer = []
        self.priorities = []

    def add(self, experience):
        """Add experience with maximum priority"""
        max_priority = max(self.priorities) if self.priorities else 1.0

        # Your code here
        # Add experience to buffer with priority

    def sample(self, batch_size, alpha=0.6, beta=0.4):
        """Sample batch based on priorities"""
        # Your code here
        # Implement prioritized sampling

        return batch, indices, weights

```

**Challenge 3: Implement Double DQN**
Modify the basic DQN to implement Double DQN architecture.

```python
class DoubleDQNAgent:
    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size):
        self.state_size = state_size
        self.action_size = action_size
        self.memory = deque(maxlen=2000)
        self.gamma = 0.99
        self.epsilon = 1.0
        self.epsilon_min = 0.01
        self.epsilon_decay = 0.995

        # Create two networks
        self.main_network = DQN(state_size, action_size)
        self.target_network = DQN(state_size, action_size)
        self.update_target_network()

    def update_target_network(self):
        """Copy weights from main network to target network"""
        # Your code here

    def get_action(self, state):
        """Get action using Double DQN strategy"""
        # Your code here

    def train(self, batch_size):
        """Implement Double DQN training"""
        # Your code here

```

**Challenge 4: Dueling DQN Architecture**
Implement a Dueling DQN architecture that separates state value and advantage streams.

```python
class DuelingDQN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):
        super(DuelingDQN, self).__init__()

        # Feature layer
        self.feature_layer = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_size, 128),
            nn.ReLU()
        )

        # Value stream
        self.value_stream = nn.Sequential(
            # Your code here
        )

        # Advantage stream
        self.advantage_stream = nn.Sequential(
            # Your code here
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        """Implement forward pass combining value and advantage"""
        # Your code here

```

**Challenge 5: Multi-Step Learning**
Implement n-step returns for more efficient learning.

```python
class NStepReplayBuffer:
    def __init__(self, capacity, n_step, gamma):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.n_step = n_step
        self.gamma = gamma
        self.buffer = deque(maxlen=capacity)
        self.n_step_buffer = deque(maxlen=n_step)

    def _get_n_step_info(self):
        """Calculate n-step return"""
        # Your code here

    def push(self, state, action, reward, next_state, done):
        """Add transition to n-step buffer"""
        # Your code here

```

Here's a solution for Challenge 1 to get you started:

```python
def train_lunar_lander():
    env = gym.make('LunarLander-v2')
    state_size = env.observation_space.shape[0]
    action_size = env.action_space.n
    agent = DQNAgent(state_size, action_size)
    batch_size = 64
    episodes = 1000
    scores = []

    for e in range(episodes):
        state = env.reset()
        total_reward = 0

        for time in range(1000):
            action = agent.act(state)
            next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
            agent.remember(state, action, reward, next_state, done)
            state = next_state
            total_reward += reward

            if len(agent.memory) > batch_size:
                agent.replay(batch_size)

            if done:
                break

        scores.append(total_reward)
        mean_score = np.mean(scores[-100:])
        print(f"Episode: {e}/{episodes}, Score: {total_reward:.2f}, Avg Score: {mean_score:.2f}")

        if mean_score > 200:
            print("Environment solved!")
            break

    return agent, scores
```
