LunarLander environment, since it's a good stepping stone to more complex implementations.

Here's your task:

**Challenge 1: LunarLander Environment**

1. First, set up the basic environment:

```python
import gym
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import numpy as np
from collections import deque
import random

# Set random seeds for reproducibility
torch.manual_seed(42)
np.random.seed(42)
random.seed(42)
```

2. Here's the DQN model structure - complete the forward method:

```python
class DQN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):
        super(DQN, self).__init__()
        self.network = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_size, 128),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(128, 64),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(64, output_size)
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        # Your code here
        # Hint: Process the input through the network
        pass
```

3. Complete the DQNAgent class:

```python
class DQNAgent:
    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size):
        self.state_size = state_size
        self.action_size = action_size
        self.memory = deque(maxlen=100000)
        self.gamma = 0.99    # discount rate
        self.epsilon = 1.0   # exploration rate
        self.epsilon_min = 0.01
        self.epsilon_decay = 0.995
        self.learning_rate = 0.001

        # Create the DQN
        # Your code here

        # Create the optimizer
        # Your code here

    def remember(self, state, action, reward, next_state, done):
        # Store experience in memory
        # Your code here
        pass

    def act(self, state):
        # Implement epsilon-greedy action selection
        # Your code here
        pass

    def replay(self, batch_size):
        # Implement experience replay
        # Your code here
        pass
```

4. Implement the training loop:

```python
def train():
    env = gym.make('LunarLander-v2')
    state_size = env.observation_space.shape[0]  # 8 dimensions
    action_size = env.action_space.n  # 4 actions

    agent = DQNAgent(state_size, action_size)
    batch_size = 64
    episodes = 500

    scores = []

    # Your training loop code here
    # Remember to:
    # 1. Reset environment for each episode
    # 2. Step through environment
    # 3. Store experiences
    # 4. Train on batch
    # 5. Track scores
    # 6. Implement early stopping if solved
```

Try to implement these components. Some hints:

- LunarLander is considered solved when you get average reward of 200+ over 100 consecutive episodes
- The state space has 8 dimensions (position, velocity, angle, etc.)
- There are 4 possible actions (do nothing, fire left engine, fire main engine, fire right engine)

Good luck! ðŸš€
