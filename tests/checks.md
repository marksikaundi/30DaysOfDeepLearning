shell script that uses tools like `pylint` and `flake8` to analyze Python code for performance and style improvements. These tools provide detailed reports on code quality, including potential performance issues and adherence to PEP 8 style guidelines.

Here's a step-by-step guide to creating such a shell script:

1. **Install the Required Tools**:
   Make sure you have `pylint` and `flake8` installed. You can install them using `pip`:
   ```sh
   pip install pylint flake8
   ```

2. **Create the Shell Script**:
   Create a shell script named `analyze_code.sh` with the following content:

   ```sh
   #!/bin/bash

   # Check if a file is provided
   if [ -z "$1" ]; then
     echo "Usage: $0 <python_file>"
     exit 1
   fi

   PYTHON_FILE=$1

   # Check if the file exists
   if [ ! -f "$PYTHON_FILE" ]; then
     echo "File not found: $PYTHON_FILE"
     exit 1
   fi

   echo "Analyzing $PYTHON_FILE for performance and style issues..."

   # Run pylint for performance and style checks
   echo "Running pylint..."
   pylint $PYTHON_FILE

   # Run flake8 for style checks
   echo "Running flake8..."
   flake8 $PYTHON_FILE

   echo "Analysis complete."
   ```

3. **Make the Script Executable**:
   Make the shell script executable by running:
   ```sh
   chmod +x analyze_code.sh
   ```

4. **Run the Script**:
   You can now run the script on any Python file. For example:
   ```sh
   ./analyze_code.sh your_script.py
   ```

### Explanation of the Script

- **Argument Check**: The script first checks if a Python file is provided as an argument. If not, it prints a usage message and exits.
- **File Existence Check**: It then checks if the provided file exists. If not, it prints an error message and exits.
- **Analysis**: The script runs `pylint` and `flake8` on the provided Python file and prints the results.

### Example Output

When you run the script, you will see output similar to the following:

```sh
Analyzing your_script.py for performance and style issues...
Running pylint...
************* Module your_script
your_script.py:1:0: C0114: Missing module docstring (missing-module-docstring)

```

### Additional Tools

You can also consider integrating other tools for more comprehensive analysis:

- **`mypy`**: For type checking.
  ```sh
  pip install mypy
  mypy your_script.py
  ```

- **`black`**: For automatic code formatting.
  ```sh
  pip install black
  black your_script.py
  ```

- **`isort`**: For sorting imports.
  ```sh
  pip install isort
  isort your_script.py
  ```
