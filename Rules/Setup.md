Setting up Google Colab to run TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras is straightforward since Google Colab comes with TensorFlow pre-installed. Here is a step-by-step guide to ensure you have the correct versions and everything set up properly:

### Step 1: Open Google Colab

1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Sign in with your Google account if you are not already signed in.
3. Click on "New Notebook" to create a new notebook.

### Step 2: Check the TensorFlow Version

Google Colab usually comes with the latest version of TensorFlow pre-installed. However, you can check the version and install TensorFlow 2.0 if needed.

1. In a new code cell, type the following code to check the TensorFlow version:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.__version__)
```

2. Run the cell by pressing `Shift + Enter`.

### Step 3: Install TensorFlow 2.0 (if not already installed)

If the version is not 2.x, you can install TensorFlow 2.0 by running the following command:

```python
!pip install tensorflow==2.0.0
```

### Step 4: Verify the Installation

After installing TensorFlow 2.0, verify the installation by checking the version again:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.__version__)
```

### Step 5: Import Keras

TensorFlow 2.0 includes Keras as its high-level API. You can import Keras directly from TensorFlow:

```python
from tensorflow import keras
```

### Step 6: Test TensorFlow and Keras

To ensure everything is set up correctly, you can run a simple test to create and train a basic neural network model. Here is an example using the MNIST dataset:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Load the MNIST dataset
mnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()

# Normalize the data
x_train, x_test = x_train / 255.0, x_test / 255.0

# Build a simple model
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dropout(0.2),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5)

# Evaluate the model
model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
```

### Step 7: Save Your Notebook

1. Click on "File" in the top-left corner.
2. Select "Save" or "Save a copy in Drive" to save your notebook.

### Additional Tips

- **GPU Support**: If you want to use GPU acceleration, go to "Runtime" > "Change runtime type" and select "GPU" as the hardware accelerator.
- **Libraries**: You can install additional libraries using `!pip install <library-name>` in a code cell.

By following these steps, you should have Google Colab set up to run TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras, allowing you to build and train neural network models efficiently.
