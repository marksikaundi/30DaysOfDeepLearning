Running TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras in Google Colab is generally straightforward, but there are a few best practices and rules you should follow to ensure a smooth experience. Here is a rule set to help you get started and avoid common pitfalls:

### Rule Set for Running TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras in Google Colab

#### 1. **Check TensorFlow Version**

- Always check the pre-installed TensorFlow version to ensure it meets your requirements.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.__version__)
```

#### 2. **Install Specific TensorFlow Version (if needed)**

- If the pre-installed version is not what you need, install the specific version.

```python
!pip install tensorflow==2.0.0
```

#### 3. **Import TensorFlow and Keras Properly**

- Import TensorFlow and Keras from TensorFlow to ensure compatibility.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
```

#### 4. **Use GPU Acceleration**

- Enable GPU for faster computation.
- Go to `Runtime` > `Change runtime type` > `Hardware accelerator` > `GPU`.
- Verify GPU availability.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')))
```

#### 5. **Handle Data Efficiently**

- Load and preprocess data efficiently to avoid memory issues.

```python
mnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
x_train, x_test = x_train / 255.0, x_test / 255.0
```

#### 6. **Build and Compile Models Correctly**

- Use TensorFlow 2.0's Keras API to build and compile models.

```python
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

#### 7. **Train and Evaluate Models**

- Train and evaluate your models using the appropriate methods.

```python
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5)
model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
```

#### 8. **Save and Load Models**

- Save your trained models for future use.

```python
model.save('my_model.h5')
# To load the model
model = keras.models.load_model('my_model.h5')
```

#### 9. **Monitor Resource Usage**

- Keep an eye on RAM and GPU usage to avoid running out of resources.
- Use Colab's built-in tools or TensorFlow's profiling tools.

#### 10. **Save Your Work Regularly**

- Save your notebook frequently to avoid losing work.
- Use `File` > `Save` or `Save a copy in Drive`.

#### 11. **Install Additional Libraries as Needed**

- Install any additional libraries you need using `!pip install <library-name>`.

```python
!pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

#### 12. **Use Version Control for Code**

- Consider using version control systems like Git to manage your code changes.

#### 13. **Document Your Code**

- Write clear and concise comments and markdown cells to document your code and workflow.

By following these rules, you can ensure a smooth and efficient experience when running TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras in Google Colab.
