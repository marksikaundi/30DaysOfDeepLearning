Let's walk through a simple example of machine learning using Python. We'll use the Iris dataset, which is a classic dataset in machine learning. The goal will be to classify iris flowers into three species based on their features.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Install Required Libraries

First, make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

#### Step 2: Import Libraries and Load Data

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load the Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
data = pd.DataFrame(iris.data, columns=iris.feature_names)
data['species'] = iris.target

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
print(data.head())
```

#### Step 3: Prepare the Data

We'll split the data into features (X) and labels (y), and then into training and test sets.

```python
# Features (independent variables)
X = data.drop('species', axis=1)

# Labels (dependent variable)
y = data['species']

# Split the data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

#### Step 4: Train the Model

We'll use a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier for this example.

```python
# Initialize the model
model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

#### Step 5: Make Predictions

We'll use the trained model to make predictions on the test set.

```python
# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

#### Step 6: Evaluate the Model

We'll evaluate the model's performance using accuracy.

```python
# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

#### Full Code

Here's the full code for the example:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load the Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
data = pd.DataFrame(iris.data, columns=iris.feature_names)
data['species'] = iris.target

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
print(data.head())

# Features (independent variables)
X = data.drop('species', axis=1)

# Labels (dependent variable)
y = data['species']

# Split the data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize the model
model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

### Explanation

1. **Loading the Data**: We load the Iris dataset and convert it into a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation.

2. **Preparing the Data**: We separate the features (X) from the labels (y) and split the data into training and test sets.

3. **Training the Model**: We initialize a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier and train it using the training data.

4. **Making Predictions**: We use the trained model to make predictions on the test set.

5. **Evaluating the Model**: We calculate the accuracy to evaluate the model's performance.

This example provides a basic introduction to machine learning and how to implement a simple K-Nearest Neighbors classifier using Python and scikit-learn. As you progress, you can explore more complex models and techniques.

#### Step 5: Make Predictions

Step 5: Making Predictions. This step involves using the trained model to predict the labels for the test data. Here's a detailed explanation and the corresponding code.

### Step 5: Make Predictions

After training the model, we use it to predict the labels for the test set. This step is crucial because it allows us to see how well our model generalizes to new, unseen data.

#### Code for Making Predictions

```python
# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Display the predicted labels
print("Predicted labels:", y_pred)

# Display the actual labels
print("Actual labels:   ", y_test.values)
```

### Explanation

1. **`model.predict(X_test)`**: This line uses the trained model to predict the labels for the test set features (`X_test`). The `predict` method returns an array of predicted labels.

2. **Displaying the Predicted Labels**: We print the predicted labels to see what the model has predicted for each instance in the test set.

3. **Displaying the Actual Labels**: We also print the actual labels (`y_test`) to compare them with the predicted labels. This helps us understand how well the model is performing.

### Full Code Including Step 5

Here's the full code including the step for making predictions:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load the Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
data = pd.DataFrame(iris.data, columns=iris.feature_names)
data['species'] = iris.target

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
print(data.head())

# Features (independent variables)
X = data.drop('species', axis=1)

# Labels (dependent variable)
y = data['species']

# Split the data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize the model
model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Display the predicted labels
print("Predicted labels:", y_pred)

# Display the actual labels
print("Actual labels:   ", y_test.values)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

### Explanation of the Full Code

1. **Loading the Data**: We load the Iris dataset and convert it into a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation.

2. **Preparing the Data**: We separate the features (X) from the labels (y) and split the data into training and test sets.

3. **Training the Model**: We initialize a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier and train it using the training data.

4. **Making Predictions**: We use the trained model to make predictions on the test set and print both the predicted and actual labels.

5. **Evaluating the Model**: We calculate the accuracy to evaluate the model's performance.

By following these steps, you can understand the basic workflow of a machine learning project: loading data, preparing data, training a model, making predictions, and evaluating the model. This example uses a simple K-Nearest Neighbors classifier, but the workflow is similar for other machine learning algorithms.
