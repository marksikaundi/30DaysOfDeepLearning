#### Step 1: Install TensorFlow and Keras

To get started with TensorFlow and Keras, you need to install them. TensorFlow includes Keras as a high-level API, so installing TensorFlow will also install Keras.

1. **Install TensorFlow using pip:**

   Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow
   ```

   This will install the latest version of TensorFlow, which includes Keras.

2. **Verify the installation:**

   After the installation is complete, you can verify it by running the following Python code:

   ```python
   import tensorflow as tf
   print(tf.__version__)
   ```

   This should print the version of TensorFlow that you have installed.

#### Step 2: Understand the Basic Structure of a Keras Model

Keras models are typically built using the Sequential API or the Functional API. Here, we'll cover the basic structure of a Keras model using the Sequential API.

1. **Import necessary libraries:**

   ```python
   import tensorflow as tf
   from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
   from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
   ```

2. **Define the model:**

   The Sequential model is a linear stack of layers. You can create a Sequential model by passing a list of layer instances to the constructor.

   ```python
   model = Sequential([
       Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
       Dense(64, activation='relu'),
       Dense(10, activation='softmax')
   ])
   ```

   In this example:

   - The first layer is a Dense (fully connected) layer with 64 units and ReLU activation function. The `input_shape` parameter specifies the shape of the input data (784-dimensional vector).
   - The second layer is another Dense layer with 64 units and ReLU activation function.
   - The third layer is a Dense layer with 10 units and softmax activation function, which is typically used for classification tasks with 10 classes.

3. **Compile the model:**

   After defining the model, you need to compile it. Compilation configures the model for training by specifying the optimizer, loss function, and metrics.

   ```python
   model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                 loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
                 metrics=['accuracy'])
   ```

   In this example:

   - The `optimizer` is set to 'adam', which is a popular optimization algorithm.
   - The `loss` function is set to 'sparse_categorical_crossentropy', which is suitable for classification tasks with integer labels.
   - The `metrics` list includes 'accuracy', which will be used to evaluate the performance of the model.

4. **Train the model:**

   To train the model, you use the `fit` method, which takes the training data and labels, along with other parameters such as batch size and number of epochs.

   ```python
   # Assuming X_train and y_train are your training data and labels
   model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
   ```

5. **Evaluate the model:**

   After training, you can evaluate the model on test data using the `evaluate` method.

   ```python
   # Assuming X_test and y_test are your test data and labels
   test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
   print(f'Test accuracy: {test_acc}')
   ```

6. **Make predictions:**

   You can use the trained model to make predictions on new data using the `predict` method.

   ```python
   predictions = model.predict(X_new)
   ```

   Here, `X_new` is the new data you want to make predictions on.

By following these steps, you should have a basic understanding of how to set up TensorFlow and Keras, and how to build, compile, train, evaluate, and make predictions with a Keras model.
